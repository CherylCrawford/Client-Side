/*$(#element name").val(playername").. (sets value)
    then load the value and stick into correct element.
    When click ... save settings button. Go through all cards and
    start with #1 and go all the way through to 48.
    Then if 24 cards will be active - the remaining must be inactive..
    This all goes in block code below.
    Next - when you do the refresh of screen and it reads the cookies
     for the first time then it has to set all of the settings.. the name
    the number of cards, (determine which are turned on/off. this might be a
    function call but also a function call for reading the cookies)
    The function for flipping cards or setting up the cards.. call it what?
    (Come up with name for function) Add comments of stuff that need to be
    done */
