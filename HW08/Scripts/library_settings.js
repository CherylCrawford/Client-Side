//The library_settings.js file should create a settings object that keeps track
// of the player name and the number of images used for a game. This object
// should contain the functions that save this data to and retrieve it from
// cookie storage. Because you need just a single instance of the settings
// object and you donâ€™t need to protect any private state, you can create the
// settings object with an object literal.
