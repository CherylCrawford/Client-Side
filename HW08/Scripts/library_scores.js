// The library_scores.js file should create a scores object that keeps track
// of the score for each game as well as each player’s high score.
// This object should contain the two integer variables that keep track of
// the number of turns and the number of turns that result in matches.
// It should also contain the functions that save the scores to and retrieve
// the scores from local storage, compare scores, and display a
// player’s high score.

//You’ll also need to add public methods that increment the integer
// variables, check if all the cards have been removed from the board,
// and calculate the percentage of correct selections. These new methods
// should replace code that previously worked directly with the
// integer variables.
