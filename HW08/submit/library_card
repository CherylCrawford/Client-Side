// The library_card.js file should create a Card object for working with a
// single card when it’s clicked. Since a new Card object will need to be
// created each time a card is clicked, a constructor function should be used.
// The constructor should accept a parameter that represents the tag
// that was clicked, and it should use the jQuery selector to get the img tag
// that’s a child of the tag. The Card object type should have two properties
// that store this img object and the value in the id attribute of the tag.
// The Card object type should also include two methods. The first one should
// check whether the user has clicked on a card that is blank or has already
// been revealed. The second one should accept a parameter that represents the
// first card that was clicked, and it should check if the id attribute of the
// tag for this card is equal to the id attribute of the tag for
// the current card.
