HW05  Outline 

For this assignment we will create a reservation form with complete validation.

1.  Starting with the basic HTML 5 Template (index.html) on Canvas, create an application that looks similar to the one below.

2.  Use Jquery for all DOM manipulation and event handlers.
3.  All JavaScript should be in an external JS file.
4.  Code a statement that moves the focus to the Arrival date text box.
5.  Code an event handler for the submit event of the form.
6.  This event handler should validate the user entries and cancel the submission of the form if any of the entries are invalid.
7.  The validation is as follows:
      A value must be entered into each text box.
      The number of nights must be numeric.
      The email address must match the pattern thatâ€™s provided.
      var emailPattern = /\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}\b/;
	  Be sure to trim the entries and put them back into the controls regardless of whether the entries are valid.
	  
8.  Do not forget your JSDoc!
9.  Do not forget to put a comment at the top of the code file with your name and assignment.
10. Do not forget to validate both your HTML and your CSS files.

Documentation: 

11.  You will need to create a document (.docx, .rtf, .pdf) which contains the following:
       A screenshot of your page running on your local webserver. Your screenshot needs to include the address bar 
	   with the localhost url and show all the validation messages
       You will need to validate the index.html and your CSS file using the validator (link on Canvas) and include 
       a screenshot of the successful validation (Green Bar).
12.  You need to submit your index.html, CSS file, and your external JS file along with your Document. Make sure your 
	   document is in the correct form and includes your name.
